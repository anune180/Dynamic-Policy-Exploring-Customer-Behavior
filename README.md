Description:
     This project focuses on customer segmentation and analysis in the insurance industry. It includes a synthetic dataset with customer information such as age, gender, location, policy type, claim history, and more. 
      Using Python and data visualization tools like Tableau and JupyterLab, we explore and analyze the dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.

Key Features:

- Data Generation: Synthetically generated dataset with diverse customer attributes.
- Customer Segmentation: Utilizing clustering techniques to group customers based on key characteristics.
- Lifetime Value Analysis: Calculating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) to understand customer contribution.
- Interactive Visualizations: Creating dynamic charts and dashboards for in-depth exploration.
- GitHub Repository Structure: Organized codebase with clear documentation for easy replication and understanding.

Technologies Used:
     Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau, JupyterLab.

How to Use:

1- Clone the repository to your local machine.
2- Explore the Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization.
3- Import the Tableau workbook for interactive dashboards.
4- Use the synthetic dataset or replace it with your own data for further analysis.
